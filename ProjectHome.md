libcomm14cux is a C++ library that allows communication over a serial link with the ECU in the Lucas 14CUX engine management system (as can be found fitted to Rover V8 engines).

This library has no user interface of its own, but it is used by the [RoverGauge](http://code.google.com/p/rovergauge/) project, which graphically displays 14CUX runtime information.

Documentation for the current API (1.2.0) is available [here](http://alum.wpi.edu/~colinb/libcomm14cux_docs/index.html).
